### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my research about using Multimodal Generative Models to Detect and Mitigate Adversarial Perceptual Attack against Reinforcement Learning Agents
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Computer Vision, AI 3D Vision, Machine Learning for Graphs and Mathematical Data Science
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing at the moment.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about AI related subjects.
